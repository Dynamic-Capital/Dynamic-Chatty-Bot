# Dynamic Capital Mini App

Telegram Mini App implementing a glassmorphism UI for simple deposit flows.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app lives under `apps/mini`. It relies on existing Edge Function endpoints:
- `POST /api/intent` for creating bank/crypto intents
- `POST /api/receipt` for uploading deposit receipts
- `POST /api/crypto-txid` for submitting crypto transactions
- `GET /api/receipts` for recent receipts

SVG placeholders live in `apps/mini/public` for the logo, bank tiles and QR frame;
replace them with production assets as needed.
